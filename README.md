## Description

The Memory Card Game is an interactive card game, where 8 matching pairs have to be found by using memory.

## Instructions

This is an interactive and timed game, where 16 cards are shuffled and laid out closed in a 4x4 square. Your task is to find the matching pairs by only being able to open two cards at a time. Two clicks count as one move, and the objective is to find all pairs with the least amount of moves. A star rating indicates your performance.
